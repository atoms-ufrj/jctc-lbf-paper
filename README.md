# Scripts

This repository contains additional information about the manuscript "A New Formulation for the Concerted Alchemical Calculation of van der Waals and Coulomb Components of Solvation Free Energies" considering the studied solvation system of phenol in aqueous media.
The results of the solvation free energy calculations and some python scripts used in molecular dynamics simulations and post-processing of the data are attached.

Molecular dynamics simulations were performed with OpenMM version 7.5.0 using the Unified Free Energy Dynamics (UFED) package - https://github.com/craabreu/ufedmm.

The Multistate Bennett Acceptance Ratio (MBAR) method for free energy calculations was applied in the data post-processing using the PYMBAR package, which can be friendy used in our analysis with the mics package - https://github.com/craabreu/mics.
